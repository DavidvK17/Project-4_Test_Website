Here I borrow the HTML and CSS from a Tutorial and focus on advanced DOM Manipulation. Many of these tools can be done using frameworks and libraries, but I want to know how to implement them with just JavaScript in order to gain a deeper understanding of the language and DOM Manipulation.

- Implementing smooth scrolling
- Event Propagation: Bubbling and Capturing

* Event Delegation: Nav

- DOM Traversing - Tabbed Component
- Intersection Observer API

* Lazy Loading Images
* Building a Slider Component (to be implemented)
